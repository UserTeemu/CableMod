# CableMod
CableMod adds fiber and copper cables for cost-effective redstone signal transportation over long distances. Cables are also waterproof (and waterloggable)!

CableMod is my entry for the [Modfest 1.17](https://modfest.net/1.17/) modding event.

## Introduction

Copper cables are cheaper than fiber cables, but the signal strength will decrease based on the distance.

Fiber cables are more expensive (but still cost-effective). Signal strength is the same on both ends of the cable.

To send and receive redstone signal to/from a cable, you need a transmitter. Once you have placed transmitters on both ends of the cable, you need to pair the transmitters. You can do this by clicking on the red button on the transmitter you wish to be the sender. The button will turn green if pairing has been successful. Now you can send signals!
